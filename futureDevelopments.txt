Prices of cryptocurrencies are volatile, markets reflect the sentiments and the feelings of the traders, the laws and the "hype" for new coins.
That means the market is influenced by a thousands of "offchain" factors leaving most of the things in the hands of the case. 
Also centralized exchanges and big whales generate unexpected events.

For those reason predict crypto prices with AI will always generate uncertain models.
We will generate only models which can estimate the values but they won't be able to forsee it.

One thing that we can do to better estimate prices is integrate in our model data from outside.
We can do this through web scraping, sentiment analysis and documents from the most important cryptonews websites, social media platforms or PDF regulations.
